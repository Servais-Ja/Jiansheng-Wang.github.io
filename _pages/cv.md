Academic & research experiences
======
* Protein functional sites identification based on PU-learning method
  * Fall 2022-Present
  * Advised by Prof. LIU Ze
  * Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi, China
  * In this work, we proposed a PU-learning-based model for predicting plant S-acylation sites. The work was intensively on feature engineering, and the utilize of multiple currently effective methods to evaluate the model trained on PU data (positive and unlabeled data).
  * [Manuscript in preparation](https://servais-ja.github.io/Jiansheng-Wang.github.io/files/论文.pdf)/[Supplementary Materials](https://servais-ja.github.io/Jiansheng-Wang.github.io/files/Supplementary_Materials.pdf)

* Faults identification based on entropy of vibration signal
  * Fall 2023-Present
  * Advised by Prof. Wang Bin
  * Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi, China
  * In this work, we analyzed the vibration signal. An improved composite multiscale slope entropy was utilized in our study as the features of vibration signals. And beetle swarm optimization algorithm was applied to improve the performance of our model.
  * The improved stochastic configuration network using beetle swarm optimization algorithm has applied for [software copyright](https://servais-ja.github.io/Jiansheng-Wang.github.io/files/Software_copyright_BSO_SCN.pdf).
  * We have developed a tool for feature extraction based on multiple entropies, and have been uploaded to my [GitHub](https://github.com/Servais-Ja/Entropy-for-vibration-signal).

* Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented rating prediction in recommender system
  * Summer 2023-Fall 2023
  * Advised by Prof. SONG Linqi
  * City University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China
  * In this work, we contrasts the performance of multiple recommendation models (NMF, DeepMF, SVD and etc) with LLM (Llama-7b), address the limitation of LLMs in understanding collaborative information by combining their outputs with traditional recommendation models. The work focused on prompt engineering. And through adding features generated by LLM, a llm augmented rating prediction in recommender system was proposed in our work.
  * The [paper](https://servais-ja.github.io/Jiansheng-Wang.github.io/files/ICASSP24_RecGPT.pdf) of this study has been accepted by [ICASSP 2024](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10447514).
