My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. LIU Ze](https://sjxy.nwafu.edu.cn/szdwB/gjzcB/zhslx/e86c87ce5d604faa85074fddd1d668d5.htm) from [College of Water Resources and Architectural Engineering](https://sjxy.nwafu.edu.cn/), Northwest A&F University. And I was advised by [Prof. SONG Linqi](https://sites.google.com/site/aisquaredlab/) from [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/), City University of Hong Kong, in 2023 summer.
